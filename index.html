    <h2>Package Delivery</h2>
    <p>There are numerous package delivery service providers across the United States, 
        including UPS, USPS, FedEx, and Amazon, all with widespread distribution. 
        While companies like UPS operate in most regions, Amazon's delivery services 
        are primarily concentrated in large cities and along major highways.</p>
</div>
<div id="text3" class="text">
    <h2>Grocery Delivery</h2>
    <p>Across the United States, numerous grocery brands offer delivery services within 
        a radius of up to 15 miles. Walmart leads with 5,234 locations and the broadest 
        coverage, followed by Target with 1,780 locations, Trader Joe's with 521, and 
        Whole Foods with 517.

</div>
<div id="text4" class="text">
    <h2>Meal Delivery</h2>
    <p>Meal delivery services are experiencing continuous growth, with most deliveries 
        made by bicycle or car. These services primarily operate in urban areas, 
        depending on the proximity of delivery personnel and restaurants. DoorDash 
        covers smaller service areas, while UberEats operates across the largest 
        regions.</p>
</div>
<div id="text5" class="text">
    <h2>Delivery Service Gaps 
        and Population Density</h2>
    <p>Most regions in the U.S. that lack delivery services are located in 
        geographically challenging areas, such as deserts or mountains. However, 
        even within certain distances from city centers, there are areas that can 
        be defined as "delivery deserts," where no delivery services are available.</p>
</div>
<div id="text6" class="text">
    <h2>Delivery Desert</h2>
    <p>Approximately 4 million households in the U.S. live in food deserts, 
        where access to grocery stores is limited. In these areas, residents 
        may rely on delivery services as an alternative to obtain food. However, 
        many regions in the U.S. still lack both grocery and meal delivery options, 
        eaving some food deserts without adequate access to fresh food.</p>
</div>
<div id="text7" class="text">
    <h2>CaseStudy Area 1</h2>
    <p>This map highlights a delivery desert located approximately 40 miles from Houston. 
        The nearest UPS hub is also around 40 miles away, emphasizing the limited delivery 
        service in this area.</p>
</div>
<div id="text8" class="text">
    <h2>Close-Up:CaseStudy Area 1</h2>
    <p>Upon closer observation, there are pockets of residential areas within this region. 
    However, due to the sporadic development, establishing efficient delivery services remains 
    a challenge.</p>
