    <h2>Package Delivery</h2>
    <p>There are many package delivery service providers across the 
        United States, such as UPS, USPS, FedEx, and Amazon, 
        and they are widely distributed. While delivery service providers 
        like UPS are spread across most regions, 
        Amazon is mostly located in large cities and along highways.</p>

<div id="text3" class="text">
    <h2>Grocery Delivery</h2>
    <p>Across the United States, there are various grocery brands, 
        each offering delivery services within a radius of up to 15 miles. 
        Target has 1,780 locations, Trader Joe's has 521, Walmart has 5,234, 
        and Whole Foods has 517 locations. Walmart has the highest number 
        of stores and the widest coverage area.

<div id="text4" class="text">
    <h2>Meal Delivery</h2>
    <p>Meal delivery services are also growing continuously, with most 
        deliveries made by bicycle or car. These services tend to operate 
        only in cities, depending on the location of the delivery person 
        and the restaurant. DoorDash serves the smallest areas, 
        while UberEats operates in the largest regions.</p>

    <h2>Delivery Desert</h2>
    <p>Approximately 4 million households in the U.S. live in food deserts, 
        where access to groceries is limited. Due to the lack of nearby 
        grocery stores, they may rely on delivery services as an alternative 
        to obtain food. However, many areas in the U.S. still lack grocery 
        and meal delivery services, some of which are also classified 
        as food deserts.</p>
